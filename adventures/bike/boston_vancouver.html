							<h3>Boston to Vancouver</h3>
							<i>Dates: Apr 29, 2017 to Jun 23, 2017</i><br><br>
							<p>
								I have always wanted to do an extended bike tour. Up until this year, my longest tour was 400 miles over 4 days.
								I have done a handful of other 2-3 day tours in New England. This summer I am going back to Netherlands to assist with
								Northeastern's summer dialogue about sustainable transportation. My flight from Boston to Amsterdam departs on June 30.
								I confirmed with my advisor that there are no important deadlines in May-June for any of our projects or papers.
								So I basically took the entirety of May and June off from research and classes and decided to ride a bicycle to Vancouver.
								I have multiple reasons for choosing Vancouver as my destination. One of my cousins' lives out there and his family has invited me to visit.
								3000+ something miles seemed like a good distance to cover in 2 months. I wanted to ride through Canada. As for the choosing east to west,
								I just wanted to spend any extra time I gain through the trip in the Canadian Rockies and it made sense to leave them for the second half of the trip.
								Little did I know how grinding the prevailing winds coming out of the west will be. At the end of April, I loaded trusty Novara with 4 panniers and started riding west.
								<br><br>
								<b>Boston - Niagara Falls: </b>Before starting, I prepared a tentative mileage for each day and noted the details of where I might be stopping in a planning spreadsheet.
								I pretty much junked my meticulously prepared spreadsheet by lunch time on day 1. A hot day combined with staying up real late, consuming copious
								amounts of spirits with friends the previous night all came to haunt me that morning. I planned to get to Amherst on day 1 but I was strugging by the time I got to Worcester.
								My old roommate Tim (Tianyi) was living in Worcester at the time and I met up with him for lunch. I decided to call it for the day and spent the rest of the day at Tim's.
								Over the next week, I made my way across to Niagara Falls, taking one rest day in Ithaca hanging out with Tarun (friend from undergrad) and meeting some old friends in the area.
								I was hosted by friends' families near Albany and Rochester. The weather in upsate New York was wet and cold for the most part.
								I would stop at gas stations along the way for coffee and taking a break from the wet weather. This gas station coffee habit would continue for the rest of the bike tour.
								I entered Canada for the first time at Niagara Falls. I started noticing a pain in my knee riding through upstate New York.
								This pain got worse soon, my mileage went down and I was beginning to get behind schedule.
								<br><br>
								<b>Niagara Falls - Chicago: </b>I made my way across southern Ontario without the knee getting any better. I suspected overuse and lack of training to be the causes of this discomfort.
								I took another rest day in London and stayed with my cousin Chintu who is in grad school there. The next day, I got to Sarnia where I stayed with a warmshowers host.
								I took the ferry into Michigan at Marine City and got to Ann Arbor where I stayed with my mom's friend Radhika.
								Radhika auntie lives on a farm with her husband and it was a treat to spend a couple of days there. It was much needed R & R and I wished I could have stayed longer.
								Unfortunately, I am already a few days behind schedule as I was planning on taking a week long break from the bike around memorial day week to make it to a family gathering in St Louis.
								To make time, I took a train from Lansing to Chicago which skipped about 3 days of riding. In Chicago, I spent the evening with another friend of my mom's, Nagu and the night at another cousin's family.
								<br><br>
								<b>Chicago - Minneapolis: </b>The knee still wasn't feeling much better at this point. On the plus side, it didn't get worse either. I rode through Madison which was a pleasure riding through.
								Madison would be my favorite city for biking until I got to Minneapolis. The roads in the western part of Wisconsin were scenic and the pavement is smooth with wide shoulders to ride in.
								The weather in Wisconsin was also wet half the time but at least it wasn't 45 F like it was in New York. I hiked to the bluffs in La Crosse one morning with a warmshowers host Jake.
								Jake rode for 20 miles with me the next day and that was the longest company I had on the road the entire trip. I rode along the Mississippi river that day and set up camp by a lake.
								I was slightly worried the water levels may rise overnight with the rain and reach my tent but luckily the rain wasn't that bad. The next day, I made a 105 mile push to Minneapolis.
								Minneapolis' bike infrstructure is the best I have seen in the US and it was so easy and stressfree riding through the city. I stayed my another cousin in Minneapolis.
								This is where I will be leaving my bike and taking a train to St Louis for a week for the family gathering. This long break form the bike helped heal my knee.
								I also had a great time seeing cousins, aunts, and uncles that I have not seen in a while. I took another train back to Minneapolis and reunited with my bike.
								My cousin's family in Minneapolis were super kind and they tried to get me to stay for a few more days. But the call of the Canadian Rockies was too strong for me to stay longer.
								<br><br>
								<b>Minneapolis - Canmore: </b>The western part of Minnesota felt easy as I followed a couple of nice bike trails for over a 100 miles. I entered North Dakota at Fargo.
								I thought that I would find ND to be boring but as I made my way northwest from Fargo, I loved the state due to the engaging conversations I had with the locals in many small towns I passed through.
								The towns and cities are more distantly spaced here than the first half of the ride. Most towns I passed had one restaurant/bar and a grocery store.
								I found that the bars are the best places to get to know the local people and the town gossip. The locals were also the ones who would tell me the best places to camp in their area.
								I was frequently treated with meals and drinks by the locals. The geography was a little boring but the people more than made up for it.
								North Dakota is also the first place I experienced the demoralizing effect of headwinds without any wind breaks. I kept chipping away at the miles and crossed back into Canada at Portal.
								Saskachewan was a lot of prairie land which means not much to stop the winds. I would have three days of brutal headwinds or crosswinds for every one day of favorable wind.
								Some of the days were hard going when I wouldn't average more than 6-7 mph. My legs were feeling strong at this point but the wind sometimes was unforgiving.
								Sometimes, people in cars would wind their windows down and ask if I needed help when they see me moving real slow against the wind.
								Others would shout out of their windows that I am going the wrong way and I should be going east instead. I followed the Trans-Canada highway for the most part as it was the only road in the area going west.
								On the days with a good tailwind, the miles would fly by without much effort. One such day, I started 140 miles east of Calgary and I had planned to stop halfway to Calgary and camp for the night.
								I started riding at 9 am and the wind gave me enough of a boost that I rode 70 miles without stopping in 4 hours on a steady gentle uphill road. I decided to keep pushing to Calgary that day.
								I made it to Calgary around 8 pm that night with a total of 143 miles for the day. Earlier that afternoon I rode through an indegenous reservation and stopped at a house for water.
								I was treated to some ice cold beer instead and had fun little chat with the locals. They tried to convince me that I should marry one of their firends and live on the reservation.
								The next day, I rode from Calgary to Canmore and I finally reach the part I have been looking forward to for several weeks - Canadian Rockies.
								Since leaving Minneapolis, I have ridden 1200 miles in two weeks without a rest day. I am ahead of schedule when I arrived in Canmore. I stayed a warmshower host's home along with two other cyclists they were hosting.
								The other bike travellers, Andy and Mel met a few days ago on the road and biked together from west. Mel is on her way east and Andy is headed south after Canmore.
								They were both a delight to chat with. Our host agreed to host all three of us for an extra day and we explored the city, visting breweries and local stores. Canmore is definitely my favorite city in the area.
