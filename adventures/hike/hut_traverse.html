							<h3>White Mountains Hut Traverse</h3>
							<i>August 31, 2020</i><br><br>
							<iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/activities/3995239597/embed/37dd072e8c146404ca003c6e64c3414f3ec0730d'></iframe>
							<p>
								Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) maintains eight huts in the the White Mountains along the Appalachian Trail (AT). The huts are roughly spaced about a day's hike apart.
								The hut traverse is a hike that tags all eight huts. Sensible people would probably split the traverse over several days. Some try to hike it in a day.
								There are no rules for how someone should do the traverse but those that intend to do it in a day can follow any route of their choice.
								The clock starts at the first hut and ends at the last hut. Seasoned white mountains hikers challenge themsleves to do it in 24 hours.
								The common order of huts in the east-west direction is Carter Notch, Madison Spring, Lakes of the Clouds, Mizpah Spring, Zealand Falls, Galehead, Greenleaf, and Lonesome Lake huts.
								The total mileage depends on the route choice but the most efficient route comes to about 49 miles between Carter Notch and Lonesome Lake huts.
								If you were to include the hike in to the first hut and hike out from the last hut, the total mileage is about 54.5 miles.
								This huge mileage day also includes about 18000 feet of elevation gain on some of the most rugged, technical terrain in the area.
								<br><br>
								I have been putting in some high mileage days on the trails this year but the hut traverse is longer and harder than anything else I have ever done.
								My longest hike/run before this was 41 miles and the most elevation I climbed in a day is close to 10,000 feet. I had no idea if I am capable of doing this in a day.
								The days are becoming shorter and I figured I'd give it a shot. If I fail, at least this would be a solid experience and good recon for my next attempt.
								I decided to do it east to west to get the presidentials out of the way early. The huts are all closed for overnight use this season due to COVID-19.
								AMC installed outdoor water spigots for hikers and the huts are open during the day for bathroom use.
								<br><br>
								<b>Planning/Logistics: </b>AMC was not operating hiker shuttles this year and this is a point to point hike. Fortunately, Lou was kind enough to be a one-man crew and shuttle support for this.
								I will also be joined by Will on the traverse. I am super glad he was able to join as I am still not very certain if I have it in me to complete the traverse.
								Will recently set a new FKT for the unsupported White Mountains Direttissima. So I know I am in good company for the hike.
								The plan was for Will and I to start hiking from Nineteen Mile Brook trailhead at 2 am towards Carter Notch Hut. I anticipated the whole thing to take 21 hours.
								Lou is to meet us at the Rt 302 road crossing near the AMC Highland Center around noon with supplies and pick us up if we decided to quit halfway.
								He is to then again meet us at the Lafayette Place Campground parking lot late that night and drive us back to our car on Rt 16. This plan changed quite a bit as the day went on.
								<br><br>
								<b>Hike in to Carter Notch: </b>Will and I were awake and packed by 1am. We ate some breakfast and drove to the Nineteen Mile Brook trailhead. We started hiking towards Carter Notch Hut at 2am.
								The trail up was nice and goes up at a consistent grade. We hiked at a good pace and covered the 3.8 miles to the hut in 1hr 15mins. We filled some water at the huts and left the hut at 3:20.
								The clock started ticking and we had 24 hours to get to Lonesome Lake Hut.
								<br><br>
								<b>Carter Notch - Madison Spring: </b>We made it back to the parking lot quick as we ran the mellower lower part of the trail. After a short road walk, we reached the Great Gulf trail.
								The Great Gulf trail climbs at easy grades and soon we reached Osgood trail. We chose Osgood trail over Madison Gulf trail. The grade got steeper on the upper part of the Osgood trail.
								Our pace slowed down and I started feeling soreness behind my left knee. We popped above treeline just as the sun was rising. The wind got stronger and the temperature was about 40 F.
								We put on some layers and soon reached the Osgood junction. Here, we took the Parapet trail to bypass the summit of Madison. Parapet trail was rough.
								It was rocky, wet and the evergreen bushes on either side engulfed the trail frequently. It was slow going on the Parapet trail and we were both soaked with dew by the time we reached Madison Spring hut.
								The hut was not open yet and it was windy and socked in clouds. We ate some food and filled up on water as we sheltered from the wind next to the hut.
								After a short break at the hut, we left the hut at 7:20.
								<br><br>
								<b>Madison Spring to Lakes: </b>We took the Gulfside trail after Madison hut and hiked up to the shoulder of Mt Adams. We are skipping the summits on this hike.
								The rocks on Gulfside trail looked dry but we were slipping constantly on many of them. Not sure if the tread on our shoes was bad or if the rocks were just slippery. The wind is still relentless and we are still in a cloud.
								So much for the clear, sunny day that was on the forecast. We then made it past the shoulders of Jefferson and Clay. At the intersection of Sphinx trail and Gulfside, we saw a trail sign completely blown over.
								We passed someone doing the presi traverse near Clay. The wet slippery rocks were not making it easy to move fast. We took the Westside trail to bypass the summit of Mt Washington.
								As we approached the cog rail, some tourists in the train waved at us. We returned the wave and crossed under the tracks. The sun came out and the temperatures picked up. We took off some layers and made it to Crawford Path.
								Soon, we were at Lakes of the Clouds hut. The hut was locked when we got there just after 10:00. We think the caretaker might have gone to pack some supplies. We filled up our water and ate some banana bread.
								We took a break at the hut in the sun that finally came out to stay. We left the hut at 10:25 and sent a text to Lou updating him on our progress.
								<br><br>
								<b>Lakes to Mizpah: </b>The sun is out and the rocks don't seem to be slippery anymore. We kept to Craford path and bypassed the summits of Monroe and Eisenhower. 
								We were passed by another guy who is attempting the traverse. He was moving faster than us and we chatted for a little bit before he took off. Meanwhile, I have been needing to use the bathroom since before the Lakes.
								With Lakes hut closed, the next option is Mizpah. Luckily, it was less than 5 miles between the huts. We left Crawford path and took Webster Cliff trail. There were a couple of ladders approaching Mizpah hut.
								You hear Mizpah hut before you see it. It just pops up on the trail. I used the bathroom and filled water here. From here, it is less than 3 miles to the Highland center where Lou was waiting for us. We left Mizpah hut at 12:20.
								<br><br>
								<b>Mizpah to Zealand Falls: </b>Going down from Mizpah, there was some running down the trail and we made good time getting down to Rt 302 where Lou was parked by Crawford Depot. We reached Lou at 13:00, about an hour behind schedule.
								We have done about 28 miles so far and this is approximately the halfway point for the hike. This is also the most logical bail out point. Physically, I was feeling a bit fatigued but still doing good. My knee didn't get worse after the climb up Madison.
								I changed socks, ate some snacks and picked up some extra food from Lou's truck. We took a nice long 45 minute break and Will decided not to continue with the traverse as he wasn't in the right head space for it.
								I briefly thought about quitting as well. Instead, I decided to keep moving  even though I knew I won't be any faster in the second half. From here, it is not about the time in my head but just getting to that last hut.
								I left Rt 302 at 13:45 and made steady progress up on Avalan and A-Z trails to the shoulder of Mt Tom. After that, it is all downhill to Zealand Falls hut. I got to Zealand Falls hut at 16:00.
								I filled up water, ate a sandwich and chatted with a thru-hiker while I charged my phone using my battery pack. I was sorely tempted to take a dip at the falls, but I knew that I would probably not want to continue on if I did that.
								I left Zealand hut at 16:25.
								<br><br>
								<b>Zealand Falls to Galehead: </b>The climb up to Zeacliff on Twinway was faster than I anticipated. I was feeling better than I expected. I saw some lumber near Zeacliff that looked like it has been air dropped.
								Continuing on Twinway, I got to the spur of Zealand mountain. I decided to do the short spur to the summit. I made it to Mt Guyot at which point I am on the Pemi loop which I hiked last month. I got to South Twin summit at 19:05 as the sun was getting low on the horizon.
								Looking west, I could see both the sun and the moon in the same direction which was neat. I had the summit to myself as I took in the scenery and ate a slice of banana bread. The descent down to Galehead was not easy with numerous tall step-downs.
								I have been on this trail 4 times in the past but never in this direction. I know this trail is steep and slow going up, I didn't anticipate it would be this slow going down too. The brilliant orange light of the setting sun made the west facing trail beautiful and eerie looking.
								I made it to Galehead hut at 19:45. The sun had set and I got the headlamp out and replaced the batteries with fresh ones. I filled up on water and left the hut at 20:00.
								<br><br>
								<b>Galehead to Greenleaf: </b>This is the section of the trail that I was most worried about even during the planning stages. Mt Garfield has always made me feel slow with its long, steep, wet climbs that seem to go on forever.
								It wasn't any different this time around. I started playing some music on my headphones at this point. By Garfield RIdge trail standards, the trail wasn't terrible but I still felt like I was moving at a snail's pace.
								After what seemed like an eternity, I made it to the summit of Garfield. The moon is bright and nearly full. I sent a quick text out to Lou and Will giving them a status update.
								I seemed to be moving a bit more robotically between Garfield and Lafayette. It is my usual bed time and it is starting to show.
								Once I got above treeline approaching Lafayette, the wind picked up and I lost the trail a couple of times on the slabs. The wind had a waking up effect on me and I could see the outline of Lafayatte summit.
								Everytime I got up over a bump thinking I am almost at the summit, I would look up to the summit still a ways ahead. After what felt like twenty false summits, I reached the real summit just after midnight. 
								I started making my way down towards Greenleaf hut. My progress has been slow above treeline with the wind and navigation by headlamp was also tricky. I eventually made it to Greenleaf hut. This is the only hut that I have not visited before.
								I didn't really linger at the hut. I filled up some water again and left the hut at 00:45.
								<br><br>
								<b>Greenleaf to Lonesome Lake: </b>Going down Old Bridle path was not as fast as I hoped, especially the upper half. I did run small sections of the trail down below and made it to Lafayette Place parking lot by 02:05 and found Will sleeping in the car.
								I let him know that I am going up to Lonesome Lake and to expect me in an hour and a half. The grades on Lonesome Lake trail were consistent and the trail easy to hike. I made it to the lake and could see the moon reflecting in the still lake.
								I went around the lake and made it to the hut at 03:00. Burke had texted me a day before the hike saying he left a little something at Lonesome Lake hut and that the caretaker would leave it out. Sure enough, there were a couple of beers, whoopie pies and a note.
								I was tempted to drink a beer then but I was not sure how my body in it's tired, sleep deprived state would handle the alcohol. I still had to make it down to the parking lot.
								I put the beers and whoopie pies in my pack and made my way back down and got back down to the car at 03:45. The traverse time from Carter Notch hut to Lonesome Lake hut is 23 hrs 40 minutes. The total hike time was 25 hrs 45 minutes.
								I have been up for over 28 hours straight and barely made it under the 24 hour mark for teh traverse.
