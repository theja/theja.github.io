							<h3>Around Carrigain & Hancocks</h3>

							<p>
								The last few months, I have been slowly increasing my mileage on steep and technical trails. Mostly in the blue hills and a couple of times in the white mountains.
								I was looking at some maps and noticed a loop which includes several trails I have not hiked before. This loop is a perfect chance to see if I can tackle a 40+ mile day.
								I mapped a route that is 46.5 miles long with 7500 feet of elevation gain. This loop has variations that I can cut the mileage down to 30 miles if I didn't feel like it.
								I stayed at the loj on Thursday night with my running vest packed for the next day and set an alarm for 2 am. At around 10:30 pm, I woke up to a van driving up to the loj.
								It was Doug bringing some material up. I had a quick chat with him and crawled back into my tent and managed to fall asleep. I woke up at 2 and wolfed down some oatmeal,
								drank some tea, and managed to use the outhouse before driving for about an hour to Nancy Pond Trailhead. I started hiking around 4 am and made steady progress up to Nancy Pond.
								Along the way, I passed by Nancy cascades where the trail got steeper. I couldn't see the cascades very well in the dark but I certainly heard them nice and clear.
								The trail got less steep after the cascades and I managed to get to Norcross pond before sunrise. I saw someones tent near Norcross pond.
								I was hoping to see some moose at the ponds but no luck on this trip. Norcross pond had some nice views lookin into the Pemigewasset wilderness.
								After this the trail drops gradually towards Carrigain Notch Tr. This section made for some nice fun running. I approached Stillwater Junction at around 6:15 am.
								From here, I followed Wilderness Tr running parallel to the East Branch river. The trail is mostly flat in this stretch. I ran into a redliner Chris and his dog before reaching Cedar Brook Tr.
								Cedar Brook Tr is a gentle uphill all the way to Hancock Loop Tr. I broke a lot of spider webs on this trail and the footing got a little slippery and rough for parts of it.
								I reached a river crossing shortly before the Hancock Notch Tr. I had been moving for just under 5 hours and covered 18 miles. I took a nice long break at a river crossing, filtered some water, and ate a sandwich.
								Hancock Notch Tr is not steep but the footing was rough for the most part. My pace slowed down here. When I reached the Sawyer River Tr, I decided to skip a spur that I originally planned on.
								I put my headphones on and started listening to Hamilton soundtrack as I ran along the river. I soon got to the start of the Sawyer Pond Tr. I was hot, sweaty and hungry at this point. I had covered 25 miles at this point and I am ahead of schedule.
								I took a nice long soak in Sawyer River and ate another sandwich. I had covered 25 miles, and the cold river water felt great for my tired legs. I passed a few people on trail approaching the Sawyer Pond shelter.
								The pond was beautiful and all the sites seemed to be almost full by mid-day. I stopped to chat with some campers and started a slow jog towards the Kanc. I almost twisted my ankle twice in this section but cought myslef in time.
								I made it to Swift River which is running very low but not low enough for me to cross it without taking my shoes off. I didn't feel like fording it as the trail ends within a 100 yeards on the other side of the river.
								I filtered more water and poured some over my head to cool off. I got on the Brunel Tr which goes up to Owl's Cliff. The lower portions of the trail were easy to follow.
								As it got closer to Owl's Cliff, the trail got steep and the footing loose. It was real slow going at this point, my knee was starting to act up at bit on the steeps and I eventually reached the spur trail to the cliff.
								There is a nice view from the cliff and an old weather beaten sign. Apparently there is a jar with a sign in book at the top. I didn't know about it at the time and totally missed it.
								After the cliff, I started up the last uphill for the day towards Mt Tremont. The trail here felt even steeper and slower. I stopped every few steps to sip some water.
								My stomach started feeling a little funny at this point. I blame the number of granola bars and sugar I ate that day. I have been eating a granola or date bar every 1.5 hours. 
								I forced myself to eat another date bar to keep my energy up. Eventually, I reached the summit of Tremont and was greeted by some really good views. It was hot in the sun up there and I quickly left the summit to get into the shade.
								The upper part of Mt Tremont trail is super steep and I could not get a good rythm on the downhill. The grade eased out a bit more towards the end and I started half jogging and half hiking.
								I poured more water over my head everytime I came across a brook. Eventually got to the road at around 4:30 pm. I took the last couple of miles of road walk back to my car at a brisk pace.
								Got back to the car at 5 pm. Total of about 41 miles, 7200 feet of elevation gain, and the highest point in the day at 3370 feet.<br><br>
