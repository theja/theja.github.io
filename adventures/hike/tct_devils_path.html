							<h3>Taconia Crest Trail and Devil's Path</h3>
							<i>September 25-26, 2020</i><br><br>
							<p>
								My friend Lauren had mentioned the Northeast Ultra 8 (NEU8) challenge to me in August. The NEU8 is a list of 8 hikes in the north east and the challenge is to hike each in a 24 hour span.
								There are 3 in the white mountains and the rest are in NY and MA. Last week, after hiking the <a href="mahoosuc_traverse.html">Mahoosuc Traverse</a>, I had hiked the white mountains hikes in the list.
								Lauren also mentioned that she is planning on hiking Devil's Path on Saturday which planted the seeds of this weekend for me. After looking at the map of the hikes, I figured that the Taconia Crest Trail (TCT) nad Devil's Path are not very from each other and not too far from Boston either.
								I decided that I would like to hike both of them in the same trip to simplify logistics. The weather looked clear for Friday and Saturday, so I figured I'd do the TCT on Friday and hike Devil's Path with Lauren and her friends on Saturday.
								Both the hikes are point to point which means I will need a way to get back to the start after the hike. For Devil's Path, since there are others it was easy doing the car spot.
								TCT is a different matter though. None of my friends are free on Friday to hike this of provide shuttle support. So I decided on the good old bike spot traverse for this.
								This means I will have 37 miles of hiking and 32 miles of biking on Friday and 25 miles of hiking on Saturday. Another opportunity to push my limits.
								<br><br>
								<h4>Taconia Crest Trail</h4>

								<br>
								I decided to hike the TCT from north to south so that I have a mostly downhill bike ride at the end of the day. This direction has an elevation gain of about 8500 feet over 37 miles.
								It starts on Rt 346 and crosses two roads before ending at Rt 20 in the south. I had locked my bike in the woods the previous evening near Rt 20 and stashed some water at the two road crossings on my way to the northern end of the trail on Rt 346.
								I slept in my car at the trail head so that I can get an early start. No one else was parked at the trail head. I wake up at 2 am, have some breakfast and tea and I hit the trail at 3 am after signing in to the register.
								The biggest climb of the entire trail is right at the beginning. Petersburg Pass is the first road crossing that come after about 7.5 miles. After about an hour of steady hiking in the dark, I startle some animal that I heard but could not see in the dark.
								I wasn't far from my but based on the sound, I'd guess it was a bear. That spooked me enough that I was basically talking real loud continuously and clacking my hiking poles for the next two hours until daybreak. I got to Petersburg Pass at arond 5:30 am and used the porta potty that was in the parking lot.
								I picked up my 0.5 liter soft pouch I had stashed behind a rock and refilled my water bottle. Leaving the pass, I took a wrong trail up. Luckily, it ran parallel to TCT and I managed to cut across to my intended route shortly.
								I could see the sky getting brighter and increased my pace to make it to Berlin Mtn for sunrise. Berlin Mtn, at 2818 feet is the highest point on TCT. It has a large clearing with good views. The sky was a little hazy but you could still make out the sunlight in the east. I didn't linger since I have a long day ahead.

								<br>
								The trail for the most part is a doubletrack with a lot of ferns. It is also much less technical than the trails I am used to in the whites. I made good time alternating between jogging and brisk hiking.
								The trail criss-crossed the state line between NY and MA. Apparently it also briefly goes through VT, but I didn't notice it in the dark. I still have not seen anyone on the trail yet. I guess it is too early for most hikers on a Friday.
								It is not too early for wildlife though. I saw a couple of deer by the trail. One of them posed for me to take a photo, it was fearless and just stared at me for a while. I moved along stopping every now and then to eat and drink.
								The temperatures were comfortable most of the time.

								<br>
								The trail is very well marked by blue markers with white squares in them. Even with all the markers, I managed to make a wrong turn a couple of times. It probably added about a mile to the whole adventure.
								At on epoint a large owl swooped past me and landed on a tree branch. I managed to get a nice photo of it. After a lot of short ups and downs, there is one long descent towards the second road crossing on Rt 43.
								I stashed away a liter of water here. I have been carefully rationing my water all day so that I don't run out. I had a water filter and tablets with me but I was not sure about the water sources since it has been a very dry season.
								After a long downhill, there is a section of paved surface. I got to my water cache, took a nice break and ate more banana bread. I charged my phone here as well with a battery pack I carried.

								<br>
								It got a little warm at this point and the second longest climb for the day starts right after this road crossing. I played some music on my earphones at this point. This climb is also the first time in the day I felt tired.
								The climb went by at a decent pace and shortly after the climb I reached Berry Pond which is the highest natural body of water in MA. There is a seasonal campground here but it seemed to be closed.
								After this, there are a few short uphills but it is mostly downhill. The southern terminus of the trail is about 1000 feet higher than where I started. I could hear motor vehicles from Rt 20, indicating the end of teh trail is near.
								I pass a couple of hikers close to the end. These are the first people I saw on the trail the entire day. I reach the end and find my bike that is locked in the woods. The total time for the hike is 11 hours and 40 minutes.

								<br>
								I repack my pack with the bike lock and tools I might need on the 32 mile ride to my car. The hiking poles were a little awkward to pack for the bike ride but the bungees on the pack came in handy.
								After taking a nice 30 minute break eating and drinking, I start riding. My left knee was stiff for the first 20 minutes or so as I am constantly bending it while riding. I hadn't notices that on the run.
								As I kept riding and settled into it, the knee loosened up and I made good time on the road. There are a couple of uphills but the ride was mostly a gentle downhill which was great for my tired legs.
								I made it to the car in 2 hours 5 minutes. My overall car to car time was 14 hours 20 minutes for a 37 mile hike and 32 mile bike ride. I am hiking Devil's Path tomorrow but before that, my roommate kindly arranged for me to park on his parents driveway for a car camp.
								Before camp, I stopped by a river and washed myself and cooked some dinner. The cold river water felt amazing after a long outing. I have another early start for Devil's Path tomorrow.

								<h4>Devil's Path</h4>
								<iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/activities/4117986570/embed/f3bc84a6444f344ddf53a5c4ac691cce947f2c20'></iframe>
								<br>
								Devil's Path is a 25 mile point to point hike in the Catskills. The hike is well known for it's steep and rocky trails. Lauren was nice enough to include me in the Devil's Path hike that is planning on doing with some of her friends.
								We decided on a 4 am start time from the eastern trail head on Prediger Rd. There are 5 of us who are going to do the hike and the rest of the group took care of dropping cars at the end and one car in the middle at the one road crossing the hike has.
								The hike takes us over 5 mountains with an elevation gain for over 9000 feet. I woke up at 2 am and drove he one hour to the trail head and had breakfast and tea at before rest of the group arrived. This is my first time in the Catskills, but three of our group are Catskill veterans and know the area well.
								We started hiking at around 4:20 am. Sonja, one of the Catskills veterans, gave each of us a nip of Fireball. Apparently, this is a things she does. The first mountain we get to is Indian Head. We were keeping a decent pace adn made it to the summit before sunrise but the sky was hazy to see it well. We kept hiking and soon made it to Twin Mountain.
								Indian Head and Twin Mountain are not less than 2 miles apart. We drink our nip of Fireball after the sun has risen.

								</figure>
								<br>
								After Twin, the next mountain is Sugarloaf. The trail up to and after Sugarloaf is steep, rocky, and techincal. After a long rocky descent from Sugarloaf, we reach Mink Hollow shelter where I go and answer nature's call.
								We were moving at a decent pace but we still have a long ways to go for the day. There is a long and steep climb from Mink Hollow to Plateau Mtn. Once we get up to Plateau, theere a long flat section. I guess that is why this mounati is called Plateau.
								At the end of the flat, there is steep downhill to the only road crossing of the day. The 1 mile downhill loses about 1200 feet and it takes us about 40 minutes to get down it. Lauren's car is parked here for resupply and as a bail-out vehicle.
								We make it down to the road crossing just past 12:30 pm. We eat some food and refilled our water here. Lauren had nice cold beer in  her car and offered me a nice DIPA. Sonja also gave us a 2nd nip of Fireball for the seconda half of the hike.
								Lauren decided to bail here due to time constraints. The second half is easier than the first with only four out of the five mountains done in teh first half.

								<br>
								The second half starts with another long climb which takes us to a flat shoulder of Hunter Mtn. There are herd paths and bushwacks to Hunter and Southwest Hunter Mtns but we decide not to do them in the interest of time.
								A couple of Sonja's and Serena's friends are going to meet us at the col after Hunter and hike to the top of West Kill with us. Their dog Hazel is going to be with them and she is finishing her Catskills High Peaks on West Kill.
								I speed hike/run parts of the trail ahead of the rest of the group occasionally. We were joined by Jason, Amanda, and Hazel at a bridge overall a nice little waterfall. After this is one last big climb up to West Kill.
								The clouds have rolled in and the outlooks near West Kill are completely viewless. We make it to the summit at 5:20 pm and celebrate Hazel's high peaks finish by drinking another shot of fireball.

								</figure>
								Hazel's party goes back down the way we had just come and the rest of us continue our hike. After a gradual descent, we tackle the short climb up to Saint Annes. It is all downhill from here to the trailhead on Spruceton Rd.
								As we get closer to the end, it gets dark and we run into two hikers without a headlamp. We stay with them until the trailhead, glad that they got out safe.
								Lauren greets us at the end. We carpool back to the Prediger Rd trailhead. Total hike time was just over 15 hours. Two of the NEU8 hikes done this weekend and I got to hike with some cool hiking people.
								The drive back to Boston was a struggle with my sleep deprivation catching up to me. I decide to stop a couple of times at rest areas and nap in the car. I finally get back home after 4 am on Sunday concluding a fun weekend.
