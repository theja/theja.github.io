							<h3>Mahoosuc Traverse</h3>
							<i>September 19, 2020</i><br><br>

							<p>
								Mahoosuc Traverse is considered one of the hardest traverses in the White Mountains. The traverse includes the Mahoosuc Notch, which has one of the most techincal and sloest miles on the AT.
								The extrememly rugged nature of the trail makes for slow going. It is also a point to point hike which makes it hard to attempt it solo without any shuttle support.
								I considered doing this traverse by leaving a bike on success pond road somewhere west of Old Speck and hiking from Gorham to Old Speck. Instead, I decided to see if anyone would want to do this with me and eliminate the need for a bike spot.
								I asked Jacob and Mac and they both happened to be free the weekend of Sep 19 and the weather also looked dry and clear.
								<br><br>
								I drove out to Gorham on Friday night and left my car in the parking area next to the bridge over the Androscoggin by Rt 16. Mac and Jacob met me there and I packed my stuff into Mac's car and heaaded over to the loj to camp for the night.
								We decided on a 4 am start for the hike which will put on Old Speck close to sunrise and also enable finishing the hike before it gets dark. I woke up at 2 am and ate a breakfast of muesli with peanut butter and wolfed down a banana and drank some tea.
								I like my early breakfast routine even if it means I am getting less sleep. It was close to 30 F this morning, the coldest it has been in months. We drive to the AT parking lot on Rt 26 and make it there befre 4 am.
								Another car pulls in as we are getting ready to start hiking and they say they are doing the traverse as well. We start hiking at 4 am and make steady progress up the AT towards the summit of Old Speck.
								We reach the summit at 6 am as the early orange light of dawn hangs over the horizon. It is windy and cold up here. We climb up the ladder to the tower and take in the view. We decided not to stay at the top up there until sunrise. This is the highest point of today's hike.
								This is my third time up Old Speck and most of the rest of the traverse is new trail for me. It got brigher as we head down from the summit and we stow away our headlamps.
								We make it to Speck pond and I eat a slice of banana bread. I have tried this banana bread recipe for the hut traverse and now banana bread is one of my favorite trail foods.

								After a short climb, we start descending towards the bottom of Mahoosuc Notch. As we get to the 'toughest mile on the AT', we see the boulder caves and rock scrambles that gives this section its deserved reputation.
								To amuse myself, I decided to attempt this part without the use of my hands. I made it a little ways with some careful balancing and ultra high steps. I stepped on a rock which seemed solid but bam!, my face was against a rock and my right elbow bruised.
								I decided to abandon the hands less hike attempt in favor of not kissing the cold hard rocks again. I suspect the worn out tread on my shoes contributed to the fall as well.
								We make good time through the notch as all three of us are pretty comforable with scrambly terrain. The ridge walk after the notch was beautiful. We jogged portions of it and took a few breaks for snacking and hydrating.
								We make it to the Full Goose Campsite as a group of backpackers were cooking breakfast. This group were all wearing various shades of orange jackets. I guess it is almost hunting season. I filled up 0.5 lters of water and treated it with tablets.

								The trail got even more spectacular after this. The beauty of this trail rivals that of presidential range and franconia ridge trails. It also sees very little traffic compared to those other popular areas.
								We jog the easy flats and downhills whenever we felt like and make it to Mt Success. I have hiked Success before but this time, I decided not to visit the site of the plane crash nearby. We are still on our target pace for a 15 hour finish and we make it to Gentian Pond.
								There wre a couple of empty water bottles at the trail junction that we figured were from someone's water cache. We come across another pond shortly. Jacob was feeling a bit nauseous at this pint and he took a short nap in the sun as Mac and I filtered some water.
								We eventually made it to Dream Lake. The trails never really stayed very flat throughout but the steepest parts of the hike were done at tis point.
								As we were on our way to Trident Pass, Mac and Jacob remarked how this part of the trail is like Garfield Ridge Trail on Pemi loop. I disagree, I think this part of the trail is pretty mellow copared to Garfield Ridge Trail.
								We make it to Trident Pass. I decide to hike the 0.2 mile spur to the Trident Col Tentsite while Mac and Jacob hung out at the pass. I am impressed by the fact that there is a bear box at both the campsites I visited today. They must have been air dropped as the campsites are not close to any roads.

								<br>
								We then make it up a short climb up to Cascade Mtn which has a nice view from a lookout near the summit. We descend down to the col between Cascade Mtn and Mt Hayes. The climb up to Hayes is fairly gentle compared to the rest of the trail and we make it to the trail junction where the AT splits off towards Rt 2.
								I eat some salted peanuts at the trail junction as Mac and Jacob get a head start. I catch up to them after going over the summit of Hayes. It is all downhill from here. I keep an eye out for a couple of trail spurs I want to red-line.
								I find the short spur to Popsy Spring and go to check it out as I tell the other two go on ahead. The spur is so short that I was convinced it has to go further. So I bushwhack and poke around in the woods before pulling out my phone and looking up the spur on the interwebs.
								Turns out that the spur is actually verys short. I start running down the trail to catch up to my friends and this section of the trail was super runnable. We make it to the spur of Mascot Pond and I decide to check this out as well. Mac and Jacob skip this and head down towards the trail head instead.
								Mascot Pond is a nice spot and there seems to be an old mine here. I would have liked to hang out here, maybe some other time though. I got down to Hogan Rd to the end of the Mahoosuc Trail. Our car is parked on the other side of the river and it is still just over a mile of hiking to get there.
								We make it back to the car just before 7 pm for a total time of just under 15 hours. Now comes the long drive to Grafton Notch to fetch Mac's car.
								The drive felt long but we made it to the loj without falling asleep at the wheel.
								<br><br>
								This is definitely one of the best hikes in the area. While it is harder than the pemi loop, I felt this to be easier than what I expected, Maybe it was me not trying to push for some time that made it so.
								This is the 5th time since June that I have hiked/ran a distance of 50 kms or longer in a day and I have thoroughly enjoyed them, especially the pre-dawn start times and solitude on the trails.
								I will have to create more alpine start opportunities in the future.
